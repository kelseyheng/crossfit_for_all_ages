# Is CrossFit a young men's game? #

In this project, I attempt to predict if a younger athlete will perform better at an CrossFit competition.

Data was scraped from the CrossFit Opens Leaderboard (https://games.crossfit.com/leaderboard/open/2019?country_champions=0&division=1&sort=0&scaled=0&page=1) using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 

Prediction was made using linear regression model which unfortunately was not a suitable model for this dataset
